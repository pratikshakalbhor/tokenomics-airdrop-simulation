# Tokenomics Airdrop Simulation 

This project is a practical tokenomics activity where an airdrop campaign is simulated using an Ethereum test network.  
The goal is to understand token supply, distribution, and on-chain verification without using real funds.

## Objective
To design a basic token supply and distribute tokens to multiple wallet addresses using an ERC-20 smart contract on a testnet.

## Tools & Technologies
- Ethereum Sepolia Test Network
- Solidity (ERC-20)
- Remix IDE
- MetaMask Wallet
- Sepolia Etherscan

## Project Workflow
1. Created multiple test wallet addresses using MetaMask  
2. Developed and deployed an ERC-20 token smart contract on Sepolia  
3. Defined initial token supply for tokenomics simulation  
4. Distributed tokens to multiple wallet addresses (airdrop)  
5. Verified transactions and balances using Sepolia Etherscan  

## Token Details
- Token Standard: ERC-20  
- Network: Sepolia Testnet  
- Purpose: Educational / Tokenomics practice  

## Verification
All token transfers and balances were verified on the Sepolia blockchain explorer.
